# Traffic-Signal-Simulation

The Traffic Signal Simulation System simulates a basic traffic signal operation in four directions: North, East, South, and West. It cycles through traffic light states (Green, Yellow, Red) in a structured manner, enabling vehicle flow control for improved safety and efficiency. The simulation is implemented in C, utilizing structured data and basic control flow to manage the signal states dynamically.



## Functions used:
1. initTrafficSignal - Initializes the traffic signal, setting up the initial state.
2. rotateSignal - Transitions the light states to simulate traffic flow.
3. display - Shows the current light status for each direction.

## main Function:
The main function provides a menu interface that allows users to access each of these functions.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-signal-simulation.git

1. src/traffic_signal.c
Your main source code with the traffic signal simulation logic.


## Output:
North light is Green
East light is Yellow
South light is Red
West light is Red
