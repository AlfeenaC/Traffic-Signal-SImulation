# Traffic-Signal-SImulation

INTRODUCTION
The Traffic Signal Simulation System simulates a basic traffic signal operation in four directions: North, East, South, and West. It cycles through traffic light states (Green, Yellow, Red) in a structured manner, enabling vehicle flow control for improved safety and efficiency. The simulation is implemented in C, utilizing structured data and basic control flow to manage the signal states dynamically.


Functions
initTrafficSignal - Initializes the traffic signal, setting up the initial state.
rotateSignal - Transitions the light states to simulate traffic flow.
display - Shows the current light status for each direction.




EXPECTED OUTPUT
The program displays the status of traffic lights for each direction in the following format:
North light is Green
East light is Yellow
South light is Red
West light is Red
